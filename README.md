Server Side Replay Recorder
=======
Matty's Experimental Fork
-------

I'm one of the contributrs to the original `Server Side Replay Recorder` project.
This originally was a version where i was testing and developing new features.

The official project has shut down as the Owner lost interest in it.

I will keep updating this fork whenever i feel the need a new version.

For issues please only report bugs/documentation. my answer to any question like "When will you update to X.y.z" is going to always be, "when i'll have a need for it"

Updates will be slow as i have a Full Time Job and this is only a passion project that i do in my free time
